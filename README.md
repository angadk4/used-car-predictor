# Car Price Predictor

## Overview
Welcome to the Car Price Predictor project! This initiative focuses on developing a robust machine learning model to predict car prices based on various attributes. The project is currently in the development phase, with significant progress made in data collection.

## Current Progress
- **Data Collection:** A sophisticated scraper has been developed using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup. This scraper autonomously collects comprehensive data from `kijijiautos.ca`, covering essential fields like make, model, year, and kilometers driven.
- **Machine Learning:** The machine learning component is in the planning phase. The aim is to use the collected dataset to train a predictive model for car pricing.

## Project Status
This project is a **work in progress**. The scraping tool is mostly complete, effectively gathering data required for the next stages. The machine learning aspect of the project is yet to begin.

## Objectives
- To create a large-scale dataset of car listings with detailed attributes.
- To develop and train a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting car prices based on specific features.
- To refine and optimize the model for the best possible prediction accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup

## Contributing
This project is currently not open for contributions, but stay tuned for future updates where collaboration might be welcomed.
